However, i find several social audit reports , until now, still refer to the concept as the Basic Needs Wage (BNW), which was the earlier term used for this idea.</p><p>The Basic Needs Wage was first proposed in the 1970s by economist Karel Van Wolferen. The idea was to set a minimum wage that would cover the basic needs of a worker, including food, shelter, clothing, healthcare, and education. The idea was based on the principle that everyone has a right to a decent standard of living, and that a minimum wage should reflect this.</p><hr><p>Over time, the concept of the Basic Needs Wage has evolved into the Basic Living Wage. </p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>rmation_desk_person:</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p><strong>The Basic Living Wage is now seen as a more comprehensive approach to ensuring that workers can meet their basic needs.

This means that the wage should be sufficient to cover not just the basic needs of the worker, but also those of their dependents, including children.</p><p>Despite the shift towards the Basic Living Wage, some reports and discussions still use the term Basic Needs Wage.

Employee representatives are an organizational structure representing the collective will of employees, aiming to bring about positive changes through negotiation and communication. On the contrary, freedom of association is a right, allowing employees to form associations for protecting their collective interests, rather than being a mere avenue for appeals.</p><p>For instance, let&#x27;s consider a situation where employee representatives propose increasing holiday gifts for workers to acknowledge their hard work over the past year. This proposal clearly aims to improve employee benefits and satisfaction rather than being a result of complaints or appeals. Employee representatives serve as legitimate channels to fight for employee welfare and rights, not just a mechanism for lodging complaints.</p><p>Placing &quot;freedom of association&quot; solely under the &quot;complaints mechanism&quot; could result in it receiving less emphasis and visibility, as the focus might primarily be on resolving individual complaints rather than upholding broader workers&#x27; rights.</p><p>Therefore, the classification of employee representatives alongside the appeal mechanism by IETP is questionable.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/2023/07/25/chaning rooms and shower facility for painting workers">chaning rooms and shower facility for painting workers</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-25T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 25, 2023</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In the world of corporate social responsibility, there are certain areas that receive significant attention during audits and inspections, such as eye wash stations and shower facilities.
