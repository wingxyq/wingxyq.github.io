        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The concept of a Basic Living Wage (BLW) has been gaining traction in recent years as a way to ensure that all workers are able to meet their basic needs and live with dignity. However, i find several social audit reports , until now, still refer to the concept as the Basic Needs Wage (BNW), which was the earlier term used for this idea.</p><p>The Basic Needs Wage was first proposed in the 1970s by economist Karel Van Wolferen. The idea was to set a minimum wage that would cover the basic needs of a worker, including food, shelter, clothing, healthcare, and education. The idea was based on the principle that everyone has a right to a decent standard of living, and that a minimum wage should reflect this.</p><hr><p>Over time, the concept of the Basic Needs Wage has evolved into the Basic Living Wage. </p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>rmation_desk_person:</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p><strong>The Basic Living Wage is now seen as a more comprehensive approach to ensuring that workers can meet their basic needs. The idea is to set a wage that not only covers basic needs, but also allows for some discretionary spending, such as entertainment or savings.</strong></p><p>The Basic Living Wage is intended to be a living wage, meaning that it should enable workers to live with dignity and participate fully in society. This means that the wage should be sufficient to cover not just the basic needs of the worker, but also those of their dependents, including children.</p><p>Despite the shift towards the Basic Living Wage, some reports and discussions still use the term Basic Needs Wage. This may be due to a lack of awareness of the shift in terminology,</p></div></div>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IETP has grouped <code>employee representatives</code> and <code>freedom of association</code> under <strong>Appeal Mechanism</strong> category, causing controversy. </p><p>Placing employee representatives and freedom of association under the "appeal mechanism" category is confusing their distinct purposes. Employee representatives are an organizational structure representing the collective will of employees, aiming to bring about positive changes through negotiation and communication. On the contrary, freedom of association is a right, allowing employees to form associations for protecting their collective interests, rather than being a mere avenue for appeals.</p><p>For instance, let's consider a situation where employee representatives propose increasing holiday gifts for workers to acknowledge their hard work over the past year. This proposal clearly aims to improve employee benefits and satisfaction rather than being a result of complaints or appeals. Employee representatives serve as legitimate channels to fight for employee welfare and rights, not just a mechanism for lodging complaints.</p><p>Placing "freedom of association" solely under the "complaints mechanism" could result in it receiving less emphasis and visibility, as the focus might primarily be on resolving individual complaints rather than upholding broader workers' rights.</p><p>Therefore, the classification of employee representatives alongside the appeal mechanism by IETP is questionable.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the world of corporate social responsibility, there are certain areas that receive significant attention during audits and inspections, such as eye wash stations and shower facilities. These measures are put in place to ensure the safety and well-being of workers in industrial settings. <strong>However, there is one area that often gets overlooked - changing rooms and shower facilities.</strong></p><p>In particular, workers who are involved in the painting process are exposed to harmful chemicals and substances on a daily basis. This not only poses a significant health risk, but it can also make for an uncomfortable work environment. After a long day of work, a worker's clothes and body can be covered in paint, leaving them feeling dirty and exposed to potential health hazards.</p><p>Providing adequate changing rooms and shower facilities is an essential part of creating a dignified work environment for employees. This not only ensures their physical safety but their emotional and mental well-being as well. It is important to recognize that employees are human beings with needs beyond just a paycheck. They deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and to work in an environment that promotes their health and well-being.</p><p>it is imperative that companies recognize the importance of providing adequate changing rooms and shower facilities, especially in industries where workers are exposed to hazardous substances. This is not only a matter of social responsibility, but it is also a sound business practice that can benefit both employees and employers alike.</p>]]></content>
